            <p>Cognitive Science (HCI Design) @ UCSD, Ethnicity: Asian, (she/hers)</p></h4>
            <p class="card-text">I've always loved being creative since I was young but never got the chance to embrace it as something I can do professionally in the future. Right before I graduated from high school, my older sister gave me advice because I was stuck about what I wanted to pursue in the future. She was the first person who introduced UX Design to me and from then I decided to major in Cognitive Science after entering as an Ethnic Studies major. Starting with introductory design courses such as DSGN 1 and the opportunity to join the Sony Connected Learning Pathway design sprint, I was able to really dive into human-centered design and learn about design as a way of thinking and solving problems. Being a designer in UCSD has ultimately allowed me to embrace creativity not just through visual mediums but also by problem-solving and it's been an awesome experience since then.

            <p class="card-text">I wasn’t too sure what I wanted to do when I was applying to college and I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in Girls Who Code. I had no prior coding experience so I was extremely nervous to start the program. I thought it was only for super smart people that had been coding since they could type. During the program I realized I was completely wrong in the best way possible. I learned coding wasn’t as hard I thought it was and decided I wanted to learn more about it. I looked in my now university’s engineering program and found out there are so many different fields that need computer science. This is where I learned about the computer science and linguistics major. It combined the two subjects in ways I didn’t realize could ever overlap, and I realized this is the career I wanted to pursue.

            <p class="card-text">During my journey to become a UX Designer, the biggest obstacle I faced is the feeling of not having enough experience. Entering college in midst of the pandemic during a fully remote year, I wasn't sure how to access and navigate the design resources at UCSD as a freshman. Starting out with design in my second year, I felt behind and this made me hesitate from applying to opportunities because I didn't feel qualified. Throughout the year, I really came to understand that everyone has a different path and wherever I was, it was a good place. I honestly can't exactly pinpoint where my mentality changed from being scared to do it to "just do it," but I do know that having a strong support system of friends both inside and outside the design space helped push me overcome this obstacle.
